what horse does Arthur ride ?
who does Arthur suggest she carry ?
are they suggesting Arthur ride to Camelot ?
Arthur rode to Camelot and drank from his chalice .
they migrate precisely because they know they will grow .
do not speak again !
Arthur , sixty inches , is a tiny king .
Arthur knows Patsy , the trusty servant .
he knows what they are covering with that story .
Arthur suggested that the castle be carried .
when the king drinks , Patsy drinks .
unfortunately , Sir Lancelot speaks again .
